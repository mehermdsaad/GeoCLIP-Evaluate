0x3e2ee1799b51a69d:0x11caae12392618ec,"**It was one of my favorite restaurants, but Their quality of food and services has dropped a lot! * I went there with my Mom at noon, the time they open the restaurant. * The food took so long to arrive, and it comes cold and looks like it's from yesterday's surplus food. * The only plus point is the sitting areas, decorations, and atmosphere. I'm not recommending their coffee menu, not the best option here. The desserts are fine. The Dynamite shrimp is delicious, but 5 pieces for 73 SR! Anyway, not recommend till they return to the old Farzi Cafe that I first liked it in 2016",46.585855,AR Best Food,2,FARZI CAFE,0x3e2ee1799b51a69d_0x11caae12392618ec_101713522272662500637_3.png,Riyadh,3 years ago,./images/discard/0x3e2ee1799b51a69d_0x11caae12392618ec_101713522272662500637_3.png,101713522272662500637,Saudi Arabia,83,discard,24.7543739,25.116512298583984,55.19857406616211,869.2032675303213
